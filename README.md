# Stavros

# About our project:
Charity is essential and therefore meant to be done for public benefit, relief and to provide 
assistance to people at times of need in any part of the world, especially those who are the 
victims of war, natural disaster, catastrophe, hunger, disease, poverty, orphans by supplying 
them with food, shelter, medical aid, and other fundamental needs.
The purpose of our website is to raise Donations for the people in need. Users accessing our
this website will be able to donate their valuable money to a good cause. Providing food, 
education, shelter and a lot more are few of the causes Stavros supports, and in these trying 
times of Covid 19, we feel it our resposibinlity to provide any possible help and assistance.
Users will be able to view our home page and gain an overview of what our website 
provides. Home page contains many sections which show the people we’ve helped, what we 
have donated, different donation plans and also a footer section. Different payment 
methods with a donate option is also available. The beautifully designed navigation bar will 
redirect the users to an about page, where information about our team and company is 
available. The blog page lets the users access the posted blogs. The donate button redirects 
the user to a payment getaway where they can donate the amount they want to.
The website is designed as a fundraising charity, with the aim of convincing and motivating 
readers to contribute to charitable causes. It's content will include a message about why the 
reader should donate, what the donations will be used for, as well as a gateway to receive 
payments. The gateway will validate the credentials and details of payments, and display a 
confirmation if the donation is successful. 
The front-end development of the website was built with HTML5 , CSS3, javascript and 
Bootstrap Library 4. The backend of the website is planned to be built with pure PHP 
language, no frameworks. The data of the users and Website was stored in a Relational 
Database Management System, MySQL.
